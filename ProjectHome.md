Jubbles is yet another bubble breaker/jawbreaker game. The thing started as a pilot project to test the JUCE library (hence the name). It also adds a few unique features that may be interesting for avid jawbreaker fans (persistency, restart and replay games, etc).

The following JUCE features were in focus:
  * Custom skin (LookAndFeel)
  * Using embedded fonts
  * Localisation
  * Playing simple .wav sounds
  * Graphics / simple animation
  * Saving and retrieving application settings

## Why It Was Created ##
As mentioned before, the project started was a feasibility test for other closed source software. It's been fun and very much a success. JUCE has been selected for our choice of primary library - and you'll probably see why, when looking at the source code. Also, as a way of giving back to the JUCE community, a tutorial has been provided for C++ programmers interested in JUCE.

The tutorial, like Jubles itself is maintained in my spare time, so please be gentle and understand that this whole thing is just for fun.
